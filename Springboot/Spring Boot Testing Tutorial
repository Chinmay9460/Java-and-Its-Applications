# Testing SpringBoot Applicaitons -->

- We will learn how to write unit, slice and integration tests for my Spring Boot Application.
  We should write Unit Tests to verify the business logic of a perticular unit(a class, a method, or
  a set of classes), and they shouldn't be talking to any external services like database, queue or
  other web services etc. If the unit we are testing depends on any of those external serices, then
  we can provide mock implementations of those dependencies and verify the unit's behaviour.

- In addition to Unit Tests, we should write integration tests which exercise the behaviour of a 
  sub-system or a component by talking to the real services and dependent collaborators.

- When we generate our spring boot application spring-boot-starter-test dependency is automatically
  added which transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as SPringTest, JUnit5,
  Mockito, Assertjm JsonPathm JsonAssert to out application as test dependencies.
